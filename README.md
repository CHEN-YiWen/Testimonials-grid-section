## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- This is my first time learning how to use <code>display: grid</code>. After watching Kevin Powell's video, I think I have grasped the basic idea of it. I highly recommend his videos.

- I was not sure about whether I should put each testimony into <code>section</code> or <code>article</code>. After reading some materials, I considered the testimonies were more like blog posts or user comments. Therefore, I put them into <code>article</code>. 

- I also used <code>cite</code> and <code>blockquote</code> in the HTML. I believe they can make the code more semantic.

### Continued development

- I use <code>grid-column</code>, <code>grid-column-start</code>, <code>grid-column-end</code>, <code>grid-row-start</code>, and <code>grid-row-end</code> for the layout. Next time I want to switch to <code>grid-template-areas</code>, which will simpliy my code a lot.

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=1515s) - Kevin Powell's video is fanstic for beginners like me who stuggle with using grid. By following this video step by step, I get to understand the basics about <code>display: grid</code> and how to properly use it in this challenge.
- [article: The Article Contents element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) - This helped me to understand when and how to use <code>article</code>.
- [7 Alternatives to the div HTML Tag](https://medium.com/@zac_heisey/7-alternatives-to-the-div-html-tag-7c888c7b5036) - I find that I constatnly refer back to Zac Heisey's article when I am not sure about whether I should put the contents into a <code>div</code>. His explanation is super helpful.
